                      color = "black", 
                      fill = "white")+

                       color = "red")+
           theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), #get rid of the grids
                 panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
                 panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#F0E442", #adjust background

        diag =

```{r, caption = "Fig4. Visual correlation matrix for the variables"}
deca %>% 
  select(-Name) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(title = "Fig4. Visual correlation matrix for the variables",
           mar=c(0,0,1,0))
```

### Correlation strength shown in correlation coefficients

```{r}
deca %>% select(-Name) %>% cor() %>% 
  corrplot(method = 'number', 
           number.cex = 0.7, 
           number.digits = 1,
           title = "Fig5. Correlation matrix for the variables",
           mar=c(0,0,1,0))
```

# 3 Exploratory factor analysis

## 3.1 Check linearity assumption

Findings were the assumption of multivariate normality was basically met (at least half of the variables were not normal), see Fig 1 and 2. 

## 3.2 Check factoribility

Factorability of the items was examined. Several well-recognized criteria for the factorability of a correlation were used.

### 3.2.1 Correlation matrix

It was observed that all of the 10 items correlated at least 0.3 with at least one other item, suggesting good factorability. See fig 6.

```{r}
deca_perform <- deca %>% 
  select(-c("Name","Points", "Height", "Weight")) 

deca_perform %>% cor() %>% 
  corrplot(method = 'number',
           type = "upper",
           number.cex = 0.7, 
           number.digits = 1,
           title = "Fig6. Correlation matrix for the performance variables",
           mar=c(0,0,1,0))
```

### 3.2.2 KMO test

```{r, fig.width=8}
deca_matrix <- deca_perform %>% 
  cor.plot()
KMO(deca_matrix) 
```

The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was .61, indicating mediocre adequacy according to Kaiser.

### 3.2.3 Bartlett test

```{r}
cortest.bartlett(deca_matrix, nrow(deca_perform))
```

Bartlettâ€™s test of sphericity was significant (p < .05), suggesting that the null hypothesis that our matrix be equal to an identity matrix was objected, and hence good factorability.

## 3.3 Estimate factor structure

The number of factors was estimated. Several well-recognized criteria for exploring factor structure solution were used.

```{r}
fa.parallel(deca_matrix, fa = "fa", fm = "ml", plot = T)
```

The scree plot graphs the eigenvalue against the factor number. From the third factor on, the line is almost flat, meaning the each successive factor is accounting for smaller and smaller amounts of the total variance.

## 3.4 Very simple structure and BIC

```{r}
a <- nfactors(deca_matrix, n=3, rotate = "oblimin", fm = "pa", n.obs=12)
```

The parallel analysis and scree plot based on correlation matrix suggested 3-factor structure, and the VSS was also favourable to a 3-factor interpretation. This was further consolidated by sample size adjusted BIC. While results from the Velicer MAP achieves a minimum of 0.05  with  2  factors, pointing to the optimal number of two factor, and Emprirical BIC suggested a uni-dimension solution. Overall, 3 factor solution was the most universally favored structure, and it was hence adopted in the current task.

## 3.4 Factor analysis

### 3.4.1 Remove items not well explained by factors

```{r}
#factoring the items
deca_fa3 <- fa(deca_perform, nfactors=3, fm="ml", 
             rotate = "varimax", scores = "regression")
#display results
print(deca_fa3$communalities)
```

Variables Polevlt, Javelin, Hijump and Hurdles showed very low commonality (<0.3), suggesting the proportion of their variance cannot be well captured by the factors. They were hence removed.


```{r}
deca_perform_reduced <- deca_perform %>% 
  select(-Polevlt, -Javelin, -Hurdles, -Hijump)
```

```{r}
deca_reduced_fa3 <- fa(deca_perform_reduced, nfactors=3, fm="ml", 
             rotate = "varimax", scores = "regression")

print(deca_reduced_fa3$communalities)
```

Variables Longjump showed very low commonality (<0.3), suggesting the proportion of its variance cannot be well captured by the factors. It was hence removed.

```{r}
deca_perform_reduced <- deca_perform_reduced %>% 
  select(-Longjump)
```

```{r}
deca_reduced_fa3 <- fa(deca_perform_reduced, nfactors=3, fm="pf", 
             rotate = "varimax", scores = "regression")

print(deca_reduced_fa3, digits = 2, sort = TRUE)
```

Then all the items had commonalities >0.3, suggesting they can be well-represented by the factors.

### 3.4.2 Factor structure analysis for the remaining 5 items

(1) scree plot

```{r}
deca_matrix <- deca_perform_reduced %>% 
  cor.plot()
fa.parallel(deca_matrix, fa = "fa", fm = "ml", plot = T)
```

Elbow effect was observed at the 3rd factor.

(2) Very simple structure and BIC

```{r}
deca_reduced_fa3 <- fa(deca_perform_reduced, nfactors=3, fm="ml", 
             rotate = "varimax", scores = "regression")

print(deca_reduced_fa3, digits = 2, sort = TRUE)

nfactors(deca_matrix, n=3, rotate = "oblimin", fm = "pa", n.obs=12)
```

Rotation method was switched to varimax since the performance of these remaining sports can be dependent on different capacity. 

VSS and BCI results suggested a 1 or 2 factor solution. I tested the 2-factor solution.

```{r}
deca_reduced_fa2 <- fa(deca_perform_reduced, nfactors=2, fm="ml", 
             rotate = "varimax", scores = "regression")

print(deca_reduced_fa2$loadings,cutoff = 0.3, sort=TRUE)

fa.diagram(deca_reduced_fa2, cut = 0, main = "Factor Analysis, orthogonal rotation")
```

Shot-put, Discus and Run1500m predominantly loaded together. Run100m and Run400m loaded together. Though Run400m also negatively loaded together with the other factor, the variability explained is quite smaller than when it loads with Run100m 

As such, I defined the factors in the following way. F1-Shotput, Discus and Run1500m-captures a latent factor of strength; F2-Run100m and Run1500m-captures a latent factor of explosiveness. 

# 4 Generate factor scores

```{r}
scores <- as.data.frame(deca_reduced_fa2$scores) %>%
  mutate(Name = deca$Name) %>%
  rename(fa_strength = ML1, 
         fa_explosiveness = ML2)
#join into the dataset
deca_new <- left_join(deca, scores)
```


# 5 Regression

## 5.1 Check distribution

```{r}
factor.labs <- c("Explosiveness","Strength")
names(factor.labs) <- c("fa_explosiveness", "fa_strength")


scores %>% 
  select(contains("fa_")) %>%  
  pivot_longer(everything(), 
               names_to = "factor", 
               values_to = "score") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = score))+
  geom_histogram(bins=7, color = "black", fill = "lightblue")+
  facet_wrap(~factor, labeller = labeller(factor = factor.labs))+
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white",
                                        color = "black"),
        strip.background = element_rect(color = "black",
                                        fill = "coral"),
        strip.text = element_text(color= "white",
                                  size = 10,
                                  face = "bold"))
```

## 5.2 Check scatterplot

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
deca_new %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = fa_strength, x = fa_explosiveness, label = Name)) +
  geom_point() + geom_text_repel()
```

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
#draw it
deca_new %>% select(Points, contains("fa_")) %>% 
  ggpairs(lower = 
          list(continuous = my.fun.smooth), #lower half show points with fitted line
        diag =
          list(continuous = my.fun.density)) + #diagonal grids show density plots) 
  theme (plot.title = element_text(size = 11,  #adjust title visuals
                                   face = "bold")) 
```
