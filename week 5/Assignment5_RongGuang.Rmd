# Task description

## Exercise 5.1

Specify and estimate the initial baseline models for the two groups. 

Present a brief summary of the model fit and make the first step of the modification by including **(exceptionally, at the same time!)** all the four parameters known to be required for improving the model fit of both models.

Fine-tune the models step by step following the guidelines given in the lecture material, i.e., implement the modifications **(as usually, one change at a time)** testing and studying each step. 

Present the final baseline models of each group and draw the graphs

Roses are \textcolor{red}{red}, violets are \textcolor{blue}{blue}.
